> [!Info] Explanation
> - Cloning is the process of creating an identical copy of a living organism, which includes plants and animals.
> 	- When it comes to animals, they can be cloned through methods such as embryo cloning and adult cell cloning.
> 	- Plants can be cloned through creating cuttings of the plant and "encouraging" the cut plant to form roots.
> - Cloning requires an exact genetic makeup in order to function.
> - This phenomenon can occur naturally, especially in asexual reproduction (which happens in plants and single-celled organisms).
> - Due to its nature, it has many ethical and cultural factors that must be considered such as the creation of 'designer babies'.

> [!Example] Application
> In 1996, Dolly The Sheep was created through adult cell cloning.
