> [!Info] Explanation
> - When measuring distances in space, it becomes impossible or incomprehensible to use traditional measurements such as kilometres and metres.
> - As a result, scientists and astronomers created new measurements in order to ensure they can calculate and measure what would usually be distances with high values.
> - This allows for meaningful comparisons, revealing the organisation and structure of the universe, and helps us understand travel times.
