> [!Example] Application
>> [!Example] Finding Force
>> A 25kg object is moving at a rate of 13 m/s<sup>2</sup>.
>> $$F = ma$$
>> $$F = 25 \times 13$$
>> $$\therefore F = 325 \space \text{N}$$
>
>> [!Example] Finding Mass
>> A roller coaster is moving at a force of 300 N and acceleration of 12 m/s<sup>2</sup>. What is the mass of the roller coaster?
>> $$F = ma$$
>> $$M = \frac{f}{a}$$
>> $$M = \frac{300}{12}$$
>> $$\therefore M = 25 \space \text{kg}$$
>
>> [!Example] Finding Acceleration
>> A force of 52 N acts upon a 4 kg block sitting on the ground.
>> $$F = ma$$
>> $$A = \frac{f}{m}$$
>> $$A = \frac{52}{4}$$
>> $$\therefore A = 13 \space \text{m/s}^2$$
