> [!Info] Definition
> - The line of best fit (also known as a trend line) is a linear line that best represents the correlation on the scatterplot. 
> - To find the equation for the line of best fit, you can use the Gradient formula.
> - It can be used to describe interpolation and extrapolation.

> You can find the line of best fit through the following formulae.
> $$m = \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1} \space \text{(gradient formula)}$$
> $$y-y_1 = m(x-x_1)$$
