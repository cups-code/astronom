> $$\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum{(x_i-\mu)^2}}{N}} \space \text{(population mean)}$$
> $$\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum{(x_i-\bar{x})^2}}{n - 1}} \space \text{(sample mean)}$$
> $$\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{(x_1 - \bar{x})^2 + (x_2 - \bar{x})^2 + \space ... \space (x_n - \bar{x})^2}{N}} \space \text{(pop. mean explanation)}$$
> $$\text{Standard Deviation} \space \approx \space \text{average distance of each number from the mean}$$
> > [!Info] Defining Symbols
> > - If you are using the first formula (population standard deviation), you must learn these symbols in order to understand the formula.
> >   - $\sigma$ =  **sigma** (lowercase), total population mean, utilised for standard deviation
> >   - $\sum$ = **sigma** (uppercase), to sum (used in later functions)
> >   - $x_i$ = **each value** from the population/data set
> >   - $\mu$ = **mu**, the population mean (can be substituted with $\bar{x}$ for sample mean)
> 
> > [!Warning] Which one to use?
> > - In Stage 5 (or in most exercises), you will only need to use the **first formula** for simple data sets as the whole data set will most likely be considered as the population.

> [!Example] Application
> Consider the following data set.
> $${2, 4, 5, 8, 9}$$
> $$\text{Mean} \space = \frac{2+4+5+8+9}{5} = 5.6$$
> $$\sqrt{\frac{(2-5.6)^2+(4-5.6)^2+(5-5.6)^2+(8-5.6)^2+(9-5.6^2)}{5}}$$
> $$\therefore \approx 2.6 \space \text{(1 d.p.)}$$
> > [!Question] How does it differ between different data sets?
> > If there is an outlier in the data set, such as the following, the standard deviation (SD) will grow larger.
> > $$2, 4, 5, 8, 9, \underline{100}$$
> > If the data set is similar to the following, the SD will grow smaller.
> > $$2, 4, 5, 8, 9, \underline{5.6}$$
> > The reason for this phenomenon refers back to the concept of standard deviation. If the numbers are closer or farther from the mean (the distance between the number and the mean), then the standard deviation will grow smaller or larger respectively.

> [!Tip] Using The Calculator
> When calculating the standard deviation of a data set, scientific calculators have a function in order to calculate this.
> > [!Note] STAT Mode
> > 1. Turn on your scientific calculator (this guide uses fx-82AU Plus II).
> > 2. Press "MODE" and type 2 for "STAT".
> > 3. Type 1 to select "1-VAR" (single variable data).
> > 4. Type each value from the data set, pressing = with every value inputted.
> > 5. Press AC to clear the data editor (it will not clear your data).
> 
> > [!Tip] Mean
> > *This is an extra tip for calculating the data set mean, since you will need it for standard deviation.*
> > 6. Press "SHIFT" and type 1 for "STAT".
> > 7. Type 4 to select "VAR".
> > 8. Type 2 to select "$\bar{x}$" ($\bar{x}$ is the sample mean).
> > 9. Receive your result as a value.
