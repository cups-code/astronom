> [!Info] Explanation
> Linear inequalities are inequalities that contain linear functions or relationships. It uses the symbols such as $>$, $\geq$, $<$, and $\leq$.

> [!Tip] Switching Sides
> When we are solving inequalities, we can add and subtract any terms from either side **without** changing the direction of the inequality.
> 
> However, when multiplying or dividing either side of the inequality by a negative number, the direction for the inequality **must change**. For instance, if $x \times -1 > 7$ is turned into $x > 7 \div -1$, then it becomes $x < -7$.

> [!Example] Application
> > [!Example] Example 1
> > $$-5x+7 \leq 12$$
> > $$-5x \leq 5$$
> > $$\therefore x \geq -1$$
> 
> > [!Example] Example 2
> > $$\frac{5-2x}{3} > 7$$
> > $$5-2x > 21$$
> > $$5 > 21 + 2x$$
> > $$-16 > 2x$$
> > $$-8 > x$$
> > $$\therefore x < -8$$
