> > [!Example] Example Paragraph
> > "Unhealthy eating habits and diets can create a significantly negative impact on the health of our youth and cause consequences if done so. It is important to remember that when we consider less healthy options for ingredients and types of food such as junk food, it can bear severe consequences to the health of young people. For example, eating healthier options can significantly increase the nutritional value that youth get compared to eating foods that are pre-packaged, processed, or considered unhealthy. Eating healthier food can make a crucially positive impact for the benefit of their lives. Therefore, unhealthy eating habits and diets can create a consequential impact on the lives and diets of young people."
